The purpose of the course project is to provide students an opportunity to implement numerous **Machine learning models** on a real-world data set.
Each team will select a multi-class classification problem (at least 3 or more classes) from the 
Huggingface Dataset Hub. https://huggingface.co/datasets
**This is bold text**	
a. The dataset can be of the following four types.
i. Audio
ii. VISION
iii. TEXT
iv. Tabular

b. If you are a 5600 group, the data set must have the following properties:
i. More than 5K training samples
ii. More than 1K testing samples.
iii. More than 6 Attributes (excluding the class)

c. If you are a 6600 group, the data set must have the following properties:
i. More than 100K training samples
ii. More than 10K testing samples.
iii. More than 2 classes
iv. More than 20 Attributes (excluding the class)


Some domains of interest where multi-class classification may be applied are given below:
• Recommendation Systems
• Image Classification
• Search & Information Retrieval
• Social Network Analysis
• Sentiment/Emotion Classification
• Health Document Classification
• Legal Document Classification
• Spam filtering
• Customer behavior prediction
• Ad click-through rate prediction.
• Song Genre Classification
• Product categorization
• Malware classification
• Anomaly detection problems such as fraud detection

**Methods to Implement**
Once you pick a multi-class classification problem, e.g., image classification, text classification, etc., you 
will solve it by using the following Machine Learning Algorithms.

1. If you are a 5600 group, you will implement:
a. Logistic Regression
b. Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP)
2. If you are a 6600 group, you will implement:
a. Decision Tree
b. Naive Bayes Classifiers
c. Logistic Regression
d. Support Vector Machine
e. Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP)
You can use Huggingface/SKLearn library functions for your project.
