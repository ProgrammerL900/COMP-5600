The purpose of the course project is to provide students an opportunity to implement numerous **Machine learning models** on a real-world data set.
Each team will select a multi-class classification problem (at least 3 or more classes) from the 
Huggingface Dataset Hub. https://huggingface.co/datasets

**a. The dataset can be of the following four types.**
1. Audio
2. VISION
3. TEXT
4. Tabular

**b. If you are a 5600 group, the data set must have the following properties:**
1. More than 5K training samples
2. More than 1K testing samples.
3. More than 6 Attributes (excluding the class)

**c. If you are a 6600 group, the data set must have the following properties:**
1. More than 100K training samples
2. More than 10K testing samples.
3. More than 2 classes
4. More than 20 Attributes (excluding the class)


**Some domains of interest where multi-class classification may be applied are given below:**
* Recommendation Systems
* Image Classification
* Search & Information Retrieval
* Social Network Analysis
* Sentiment/Emotion Classification
* Health Document Classification
* Legal Document Classification
* Spam filtering
* Customer behavior prediction
* Ad click-through rate prediction.
* Song Genre Classification
* Product categorization
* Malware classification
* Anomaly detection problems such as fraud detection

# Methods to Implement
Once you pick a multi-class classification problem, e.g., image classification, text classification, etc., you 
will solve it by using the following Machine Learning Algorithms.

If you are a 5600 group, you will implement:
a. Logistic Regression
b. Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP)

You can use Huggingface/SKLearn library functions for your project.

# [Project Proposal Report](https://github.com/ProgrammerL900/COMP-5600/blob/main/Project/Project%20Proposal%20Report.pdf)
You must write a two-page proposal before you begin your project in-depth. These will be submitted via Canvas. In the proposal, you should (1) address the following questions, (2) include the names and email addresses of all the team members, and (3) identify the coordinator of the project, who would take the primary responsibility of coordinating the work of all team members; the coordinator is also our primary contact for providing feedback about the project. 

As long as these questions are addressed, the proposal does not have to be very long. A couple of sentences for each question would be sufficient. You should focus on the following in your proposal:

* Define clearly what dataset will you work on. (What is the primary application domain? What are the inputs? What are the outputs?)
* How Machine Learning techniques can be applied to solve this problem?
* What are the potential challenges you may face in this project?
* What is your dataset? How will you create/build your dataset?
* How do you plan to build it? Identify what technologies you plan on leveraging to implement your software. This may be programming languages, supporting libraries, etc.
* What hyper-parameters will be involved in your classifier? How would you fine-tune these hyper-parameters? (optional for 5600 students)
* How will you demonstrate the usefulness and correctness of your classifier?
* Provide a rough timeline to show when you expect to finish what. List a couple of milestones if possible (they can be tentative).
